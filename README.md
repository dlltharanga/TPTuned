**Note : ** 
1. I have completed most of the parts of below changes.
2. I didn't consider about UI changes
3. Initially I have target to the main functionality (1 to 3)
4. I didn't do any database changes


This application is unfinished. Please complete below tasks. Spend max 2 hours.
We would like to have a short written explanation of the changes you made.

1. Move data retrieval methods to separate class / classes (use dependency injection) - **Done**
2. Favorite / unfavorite tracks. An automatic playlist should be created named "My favorite tracks" - **Done**
3. Search for artist name - **Done**

Optional:
4. The user's playlists should be listed in the left navbar. **Done**
If a playlist is added (or modified), this should reflect in the left navbar (NavMenu.razor). Preferrably, this list should be refreshed without a full page reload. (suggestion: you can use Event, Reactive.NET, SectionOutlet, or any other method you prefer) - 
5. Add tracks to a playlist (existing or new one). The dialog is already created but not yet finished. - **Done**

When creating a user account, you will see this:
"This app does not currently have a real email sender registered, see these docs for how to configure a real email sender. Normally this would be emailed: Click here to confirm your account."
After you click 'Click here to confirm your account' you should be able to login.

Please send us a zip file with the modified solution when you are done. You can also upload it to your own GitHub account and send us the link.
